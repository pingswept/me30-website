Because of the global pandemic, the course is being taught in an unusual fashion. Instead of all just hanging out in a workshop building electronics for 14 weeks, we have a bunch of different elements that will combine, like Voltron, to make an awesome course.

* a central website for course logistics and notes, plus links to everything else
* a [project kit](/logistics/kit/) and plan for PCB fabrication and assembly
* collection of pre-existing resources: a textbook plus other stuff on the website
* short, topical videos, incrementally released, specific to our class
* Zoom pod sessions-- small groups of 16 people, real-time Q&A with Kristen or [Brandon](https://tufts.zoom.us/my/brandon.of.nolop)
* a [Slack workspace](https://tufts-me30.slack.com) for the course, including channels for each pod
* a [Flipgrid group](https://flipgrid.com/me30) for video documentation of student work
* community enrichment activities, like streaming electronics teardowns [on Twitch](https://www.twitch.tv/radio_polonium_active)
* email status updates weekly, crossposted to [this page](/logistics/weekly-updates/) and [the Slack workspace](https://tufts-me30.slack.com)
* some form of assessment on Canvas
