## Slack workspace

Last year, during the height of the pandemic, we used Slack, a messaging app, for ME 30. It turns out that it was useful enough that we have decided to try it again this year. (Unless we change our minds. Honestly, I'm just typing this now; who knows what will happen when the semester starts.) You should join [our Slack workspace](https://tufts-me30.slack.com) with your Tufts email address.
