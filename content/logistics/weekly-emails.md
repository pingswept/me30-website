## Weekly Update Emails

- - -



## Week 1: Wednesday, 9/7/22

**Some course housekeeping:**
- We’ll send an organizational email every Sunday evening. But this first week, we're doing it on Tuesday.
- Don’t forget to bring your electronics kit to every class.
- The course website is http://andnowforelectronics.com/. It includes:
1. The syllabus which includes office hour info
2. The calendar of topics, suggested readings, and project work due for each class meeting
3. Notes and brief videos on key topics
4. Kit component list and data sheets for all components
- If you did not get an electronics kit on 9/6, please reach out. The cost is $43, payable by Venmo to @tuftsnolop. If the cost is a hardship, please email an instructor (Brandon or Kristen) or the Mech E department administrator (courtney.russo@tufts.edu), and we will cover the cost.

**Things due in Week 1:**
- Nothing, but the LED-pushbutton circuit is due next week. Canvas deliverable: Upload a photo of your working LED-pushbutton circuit.

**Learning goals for Week 1:**
- Build a working circuit prototype on a breadboard 
- Explain how current flows through the pins on a barrel jack
- Start to make sense of voltage, current, resistance, and power, as they relate to a simple LED circuit and to a voltage regulator circuit

**Resources for your learning for Week 1:**

In ME 30 we’re aiming to provide a menu of resources to support your electronics learning. We hope you’ll explore and use what works best for you. Some of you may start with the videos we’ve embedded in the website pages; some of you may start by reading a textbook section; some of you may focus on the written website notes; and others may start with broad questions in office hours. Let us know if you’d like help developing a strategy for navigating the different options.

*For Week 1, these are the resources we’re suggesting:*
- In-class [exercises](http://andnowforelectronics.com/logistics/exercises/):  Exercise #1 (Power an LED with "wall power") and Exercise #2 (Build voltage dividers)
- Website notes on concepts: Voltage regulation, Voltage & current*, Series vs. parallel, Resistors, Capacitors*
- Website notes on skills: Prototyping*
- Electric current and Voltage sections (2.2 and 2.3) of Scherz & Monk textbook (which is optional, and available here from Tisch Library online)
- Office hours with instructors or LAs

NOTE: Many of the website notes pages include mini-lecture videos.
