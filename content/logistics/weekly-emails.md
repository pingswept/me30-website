## Week 2: Monday, 9/8/25

Thanks for a great first day of class last Wednesday. We appreciate how willing you were to lend a hand to classmates once you figured out your own circuit. That spirit of collective learning will take us far this semester.

**Course housekeeping:**
- Remember to **bring your green box to every class and lab session.**
- Check the [Calendar](http://andnowforelectronics.com/logistics/calendar/) page of the course website to see what we're doing in class each day and what to study and do every week.
- Labs begin this week in Nolop on Wed, Sep. 10. Labs are 1 hour. Bring your orange box. 

**Things due in Week 2:**
- Just the in-class activity uploads to Canvas

**Learning goals for Week 2:**
- Describe the difference between a voltage *divider* circuit and a voltage *regulator* circuit.
- Deepen your understanding of voltage, current, resistance, and power, as they relate to voltage divider and voltage regulator circuits.
- Measure voltage, current, resistance, and continuity with a multimeter.

**Resources for your learning for Week 2:**

For Week 2, these are the resources we’re suggesting:
- Website notes on concepts: [Series vs. parallel](http://andnowforelectronics.com/notes/series-vs-parallel/), [Voltage regulation](http://andnowforelectronics.com/notes/voltage-regulation/), [Capacitors](http://andnowforelectronics.com/notes/capacitors/) (includes mini-lecture video)
- Website notes on skills: [Multimeters](http://andnowforelectronics.com/notes/multimeters/), [Demo video of building a voltage regulator](http://andnowforelectronics.com/notes/demo-videos/#building-a-breadboard-prototype)
- Electric current and Voltage sections (2.2 and 2.3) of Scherz & Monk textbook (which is optional, and available [here](https://tufts-primo.hosted.exlibrisgroup.com/permalink/f/k87dab/TN_cdi_askewsholts_vlebooks_9781259587559) from Tisch Library online)
- Office hours 

**Office hours**
- [Office hours](http://andnowforelectronics.com/logistics/syllabus/#office-hours) should really be called "times when we sit and wait for you to come build circuits with us"
- Kristen's office hours this week are Fri. 12-2pm in Nolop (but usually 3-5pm Fridays)
- Brandon's office hours are whenever he's in Nolop, M-F, 9a-5p 



## Week 1: Tuesday, 9/2/25

We are excited to start ME 30 with you! Welcome to the course. We’ll send an organizational email to the ME 30 class every Sunday evening. But this first week, we're doing it on Tuesday.

**Course website:**

The course website is http://andnowforelectronics.com/. It serves as the required text for the course. It includes:
1. The syllabus, which lists office hour info
2. The calendar of topics, suggested readings, and project work due for each class meeting
3. Notes and brief videos on key topics
4. Kit component list and data sheets for all components

**Electronics kit:**

You'll receive your electronics kit in the first class on 9/3. Bring it back for EVERY class and lab. You'll return it at the end of the semester.

**Labs:**

No labs this first week.  They will begin on Wednesday, 9/10.

**Things due in Week 1:**

Your first Canvas deliverable for an in-class exercise: Upload a video from Class #1 introducing yourself and showing us your LED-pushbutton circuit.

**Learning goals for Week 1:**
- Build a working circuit prototype on a breadboard 
- Explain how current flows through the pins on a barrel jack
- Start to make sense of voltage, current, resistance, and power, as they relate to a simple LED circuit

**Resources for your learning for Week 1:**

In ME 30 we’re aiming to provide a menu of resources to support your electronics learning. We hope you’ll explore and use what works best for you. Some of you may start with the videos we’ve embedded in the website pages; some of you may start by reading a textbook section; some of you may focus on the written website notes; and others may start with broad questions in office hours. Let us know if you’d like help developing a strategy for navigating the different options.

*For Week 1, these are the resources we’re suggesting:*
- In-class [exercises](http://andnowforelectronics.com/logistics/exercises/):  Exercise #1 (Power an LED with "wall power") 
- Website notes & videos on concepts: [Voltage & current](http://andnowforelectronics.com/notes/voltage-and-current/), [Series vs. parallel](http://andnowforelectronics.com/notes/series-vs-parallel/), [Resistors](http://andnowforelectronics.com/notes/resistors/), [LEDs](http://andnowforelectronics.com/notes/leds/)
- Website notes on skills: [Prototyping](http://andnowforelectronics.com/notes/prototyping/), [Multimeters](http://andnowforelectronics.com/notes/multimeters/)
- Electric current and Voltage sections (2.2 and 2.3) of Scherz & Monk textbook (which is optional, and available [here](https://tufts-primo.hosted.exlibrisgroup.com/permalink/f/k87dab/TN_cdi_askewsholts_vlebooks_9781259587559) from Tisch Library online)
- Office hours 

NOTE: Many of the website notes pages include mini-lecture videos.
