**Resources for your learning for Week 1:**

In ME 30 we’re aiming to provide a menu of resources to support your electronics learning. We hope you’ll explore and use what works best for you. Some of you may start with the videos we’ve embedded in the website pages; some of you may start by reading a textbook section; some of you may focus on the written website notes; and others may start with broad questions in office hours. Let us know if you’d like help developing a strategy for navigating the different options.

*For Week 1, these are the resources we’re suggesting:*
- In-class [exercises](http://andnowforelectronics.com/logistics/exercises/):  Exercise #1 (Power an LED with "wall power") and Exercise #2 (Build voltage dividers)
- Website notes on concepts: Voltage regulation, Voltage & current*, Series vs. parallel, Resistors, Capacitors*
- Website notes on skills: Prototyping*
- Electric current and Voltage sections (2.2 and 2.3) of Scherz & Monk textbook (which is optional, and available here from Tisch Library online)
- Office hours with instructors or LAs

NOTE: Many of the website notes pages include mini-lecture videos.
