We are excited to start ME 30 with you! Welcome to the course. We’ll send an organizational email to the ME 30 class every Sunday evening. But this first week, we're doing it on Tuesday.

**Course Sections**

Please attend class in the location designated for your section. Each room will be full to capacity with students plus learning assistants. If you attend the section for which you are not enrolled, someone else won't have a seat. Rest assured, Brandon and Kristen will be swapping classrooms over the course of the semester, so all students will be interacting with both course faculty.

**Course website:**

The course website is http://andnowforelectronics.com/. It serves as the required text for the course. It includes:
1. The syllabus, which lists office hour info
2. The calendar of topics, suggested readings, and project work due for each class meeting
3. Notes and brief videos on key topics
4. Kit component list and data sheets for all components

**Electronics kit:**

You'll receive your electronics kit in the first class on 9/6. Bring it back for EVERY class and lab. You'll return it at the end of the semester.

**Labs:**

No labs this first week.  They will begin on Wednesday, 9/13, and they will run on a Wednesday-to-Tuesday cycle.

**Things due in Week 1:**

Nothing, but your intro video and the LED-pushbutton circuit is due next week. Canvas deliverable: Upload a video introducing yourself and showing us your LED-pushbutton circuit.

**Learning goals for Week 1:**
- Build a working circuit prototype on a breadboard 
- Explain how current flows through the pins on a barrel jack
- Start to make sense of voltage, current, resistance, and power, as they relate to a simple LED circuit

In ME 30 we’re aiming to provide a menu of resources to support your electronics learning. We hope you’ll explore and use what works best for you. Some of you may start with the videos we’ve embedded in the website pages; some of you may start by reading a textbook section; some of you may focus on the written website notes; and others may start with broad questions in office hours. Let us know if you’d like help developing a strategy for navigating the different options.

*For Week 1, these are the resources we’re suggesting:*
- In-class [exercises](http://andnowforelectronics.com/logistics/exercises/):  Exercise #1 (Power an LED with "wall power") 
- Website notes & videos on concepts: Voltage & current, Series vs. parallel, Resistors, LEDs
- Website notes on skills: Prototyping, Multimeters
- Electric current and Voltage sections (2.2 and 2.3) of Scherz & Monk textbook (which is optional, and available here from Tisch Library online)
