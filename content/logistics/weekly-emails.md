## Week 15: Sunday, 12/8/24

Great work getting those robots up the ramp. Onward to the final project, #6!

**Last Class Session Mon., Dec. 11**
- For our last regular class session, we'll talk about career trajectories and we'll go over approaches and resources for Project 6. 

**Project 6 Details and Resources**
- Please carefully read the updated [Project 6](http://andnowforelectronics.com/logistics/projects/#requirements-for-project-6)  description. We have posted many new resources and ideas for working on Project 6.
- Take some time to discuss the Project 6 resources with your team. For example, look at the [Recommended Work Plan](http://andnowforelectronics.com/logistics/projects/#recommended-work-plan) together and decide whether you will follow that sequence of sub-tasks to get the project done. Consider the [Software Architecture](http://andnowforelectronics.com/logistics/projects/#software-architecture) advice and figure out whether you have questions about it.

**Project 6 Required Demo Sessions**
- Project 6 is due during the ME 30 final blocks Tuesday, 12/17 (3:30pm) or Wednesday, 12/18 (2:00 or 3:30pm). These are the university-scheduled times scheduled for ME 30 finals. All teams, from all ME 30 sections, are welcome at any of these sessions. However, if you finish P6 earlier and you can find another team to demo with you, you can come to Nolop for an early demo on Friday, 12/13, 3pm or Monday, 12/16, 3pm.
- Project 6 documentation is due on Canvas by 11:59pm on Mon., Dec. 18.

**Kit Return**
- Note that you must return your ME 30 kit (except for any components soldered to your PCBs) after P6 robot demos.

**Office Hours for Project 6**

- Website notes on skills: [Multimeters](http://andnowforelectronics.com/notes/multimeters/), [Demo video of building a voltage regulator](http://andnowforelectronics.com/notes/demo-videos/#building-a-breadboard-prototype)
- Electric current and Voltage sections (2.2 and 2.3) of Scherz & Monk textbook (which is optional, and available [here](https://tufts-primo.hosted.exlibrisgroup.com/permalink/f/k87dab/TN_cdi_askewsholts_vlebooks_9781259587559) from Tisch Library online)
- Office hours 

**Office hours**
- [Office hours](http://andnowforelectronics.com/logistics/syllabus/#office-hours) should really be called "times when we sit and wait for you to come build circuits with us"
- Kristen's office hours are Fri. 2:15-4:15pm in Nolop
- Brandon's office hours are whenever he's in Nolop, M-F, 9a-5p 


## Week 1: Tuesday, 9/3/24

We are excited to start ME 30 with you! Welcome to the course. We’ll send an organizational email to the ME 30 class every Sunday evening. But this first week, we're doing it on Tuesday.

**Course website:**

The course website is http://andnowforelectronics.com/. It serves as the required text for the course. It includes:
1. The syllabus, which lists office hour info
2. The calendar of topics, suggested readings, and project work due for each class meeting
3. Notes and brief videos on key topics
4. Kit component list and data sheets for all components

**Electronics kit:**

You'll receive your electronics kit in the first class on 9/4. Bring it back for EVERY class and lab. You'll return it at the end of the semester.

**Labs:**

No labs this first week.  They will begin on Monday, 9/9.

**Things due in Week 1:**

Nothing, but your intro video and the LED-pushbutton circuit is due next week. Canvas deliverable: Upload a video introducing yourself and showing us your LED-pushbutton circuit.

**Learning goals for Week 1:**
- Build a working circuit prototype on a breadboard 
- Explain how current flows through the pins on a barrel jack
- Start to make sense of voltage, current, resistance, and power, as they relate to a simple LED circuit

**Resources for your learning for Week 1:**

In ME 30 we’re aiming to provide a menu of resources to support your electronics learning. We hope you’ll explore and use what works best for you. Some of you may start with the videos we’ve embedded in the website pages; some of you may start by reading a textbook section; some of you may focus on the written website notes; and others may start with broad questions in office hours. Let us know if you’d like help developing a strategy for navigating the different options.

*For Week 1, these are the resources we’re suggesting:*
- In-class [exercises](http://andnowforelectronics.com/logistics/exercises/):  Exercise #1 (Power an LED with "wall power") 
- Website notes & videos on concepts: [Voltage & current](http://andnowforelectronics.com/notes/voltage-and-current/), [Series vs. parallel](http://andnowforelectronics.com/notes/series-vs-parallel/), [Resistors](http://andnowforelectronics.com/notes/resistors/), [LEDs](http://andnowforelectronics.com/notes/leds/)
- Website notes on skills: [Prototyping](http://andnowforelectronics.com/notes/prototyping/), [Multimeters](http://andnowforelectronics.com/notes/multimeters/)
- Electric current and Voltage sections (2.2 and 2.3) of Scherz & Monk textbook (which is optional, and available [here](https://tufts-primo.hosted.exlibrisgroup.com/permalink/f/k87dab/TN_cdi_askewsholts_vlebooks_9781259587559) from Tisch Library online)
- Office hours 

NOTE: Many of the website notes pages include mini-lecture videos.
