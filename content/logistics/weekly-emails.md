### Week 3: Tuesday, 9/20/22 

**Course housekeeping:**
- Thanks for all of your hard work learning Kicad for Project 1! 
- If you’ve missed class due to illness, please check both the “Calendar” and the “Exercises” section of the website to see what we did in class the day(s) you missed. Reach out to an instructor or Learning Assistant if you have questions.

**Things due in Week 3:**
- Project 1 PCB design due Thursday, Sep. 22, 11:59pm to Canvas. Submission requirements: (1) screenshot of your OSH Park order confirmation, (2) screenshot of your Kicad schematic diagram, (3) photo of your Project 1 breadboard prototype 

**Learning goals for Week 3:**
- Improve your skills at creating schematics and laying out PCBs on Kicad.
- Explain how to use transistors to control high power with low power.
- Begin to build circuits incorporating motors.

**Resources for your learning for Week 3:**
For Week 3, these are the resources we’re suggesting:
- In-class [exercises](http://andnowforelectronics.com/logistics/exercises/):  Exercise #4 (Motor Power Supply PCB) and Exercise #5 (Control a motor with a resistor)
- Website notes:  Low power/high power (includes two mini-lecture videos)
- “Transistors” section of Scherz & Monk textbook (available here from Tisch Library online) (section 4.3)
- Office hours with instructors or LAs

### Week 2: Tuesday, 9/13/22

**Course housekeeping:**
- Friendly reminder about paying for your consumables kit if you have not already done so: the cost is $43, payable by Venmo to @tuftsnolop. If the cost is a hardship, please let us know and we will help.
- You’ll need KiCad installed on your computer to complete Project 1. If you’re having trouble installing it, please reach out to an LA or instructor.

**Things due in Week 2:**
- Nothing due this week, but you should be working steadily on Project 1 (Breadboard Power Supply)

**Learning goals for Week 2:**
- Deepening your understanding of voltage, current, resistance, and power, as they relate to your Project 1 Breadboard Power Supply circuit (featuring voltage regulators)
- How to take a breadboard prototype and turn it into a PCB design using KiCad software

**Resources for your learning for Week 2:**
For Week 2, these are the resources we’re suggesting:
- In-class [exercise](http://andnowforelectronics.com/logistics/exercises/):  Exercise #3 (Build a voltage regulation circuit)
- Website notes/videos on concepts: Voltage regulation, Voltage & current*, Series vs. parallel, Resistors, Capacitors*
- Website notes/videos on skills: Prototyping*, PCB design, Demo videos*
- PCB design section of Scherz & Monk textbook (available here from Tisch Library online)
- Office hours with instructors or LAs

### Week 1: Wednesday, 9/7/22

**Some course housekeeping:**
- Starting next week, we’ll send an organizational email every Tuesday morning. But this first week, we’re doing it on Wednesday.
- Don’t forget to bring your electronics kit back to class on Thursday 9/8, and every class after that.
- The course website is http://andnowforelectronics.com/. It includes:
1. The syllabus which includes office hour info
2. The calendar of topics, suggested readings, and project work due for each class meeting
3. Notes and brief videos on key topics
4. Kit component list and data sheets for all components
- If you did not get an electronics kit on 9/6, please reach out. The cost is $43, payable by Venmo to @tuftsnolop. If the cost is a hardship, please let us know and we will help.

**Things due in Week 1:**
- Project 0 (in-class LED-pushbutton circuit) due Thurs., 9/8, 11:59pm. Canvas deliverable: Upload a photo of your working LED-pushbutton circuit.

**Learning goals for Week 1:**
- Build a working circuit prototype on a breadboard 
- Explain how current flows through the pins on a barrel jack
- Start to make sense of voltage, current, resistance, and power, as they relate to a simple LED circuit and to a voltage regulator circuit

**Resources for your learning for Week 1:**

In ME 30 we’re aiming to provide a menu of resources to support your electronics learning. We hope you’ll explore and use what works best for you. Some of you may start with the videos we’ve embedded in the website pages; some of you may start by reading a textbook section; some of you may focus on the written website notes; and others may start with broad questions in office hours. Let us know if you’d like help developing a strategy for navigating the different options.

*For Week 1, these are the resources we’re suggesting:*
- In-class [exercises](http://andnowforelectronics.com/logistics/exercises/):  Exercise #1 (Power an LED with "wall power") and Exercise #2 (Build voltage dividers)
- Website notes on concepts: Voltage regulation, Voltage & current*, Series vs. parallel, Resistors, Capacitors*
- Website notes on skills: Prototyping*
- Electric current and Voltage sections (2.2 and 2.3) of Scherz & Monk textbook (which is optional, and available here from Tisch Library online)
- Office hours with instructors or LAs

NOTE: Many of the website notes pages include mini-lecture videos.
