In 2022, we assembled 92 kits: 83 for students, 7 for learning assistants, and 2 for professors. The cost per kit was $160, split $43 for consumables and $117 for durable parts that we hope to reuse next year. Historically, our recovery rate for durables has been around 65%, so we estimate the annual durables replacement cost to the department at 35% of $117, or $41 per student.
