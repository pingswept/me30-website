## In-class exercises

### 1: Build a voltage regulation circuit

This is an introductory exercise designed to help you get familiar with breadboard prototyping while also building a basic circuit that will be useful for later exercises and projects. It forms the basis for Project #1, but you don't need to think about that yet. If this is all new to you, look at the pages on [breadboard prototyping](/notes/prototyping/) and [multimeters](/notes/multimeters/).

Your goal is to put 4 components and some wires on your breadboard so to achieve this goal: **12 volts go in; 5 volts come out**.

The 4 components are:

1. One power jack
2. One L7805CV voltage regulator
3. Two capacitors
