## Project 4: Build an electromechanical game

Your task is to build a game with the following characteristics:

*   It is controlled by a KB2040 microcontroller.
*   It uses your H-bridge prototype to drive a motor in at least one direction. (If you need a second H-bridge, you can make another one or use any motor driver that will work.) 
*   It has some kind of user input, like a button, knob, joystick, sensor, or the like, that talks to the KB2040 microcontroller. (Read the note below about the ME 30 Nolop tab).
*   It has at least one part that moves, driven by one of the motors in your kit. (You can use both motors if you want. Servo motors are prohibited.)
*   It is at least sort of fun to play. A blinking LED is not a game.
*   It includes no 3D printed components whose STL files were downloaded from the internet.
*   Its major structural components are NOT 3D printed.

For 1 of the 7 project points you will also need to respond to the project reflection questions linked from Canvas.

### Personal learning goals ###

As soon as you can manage it, you should formulate and submit to Canvas one or more personal learning goals for the project. Building games is cool, but the real point here is for you to gain skills and experience that help you grow as an engineer. That works best when your heart is in it; this is your chance to follow where your heart leads. (Okay, that's a bit cheesy, but also true.)

**By Wednesday, October 29, 11:59 PM, please describe your learning goal on Canvas.**

At the end of the project, one of the reflection questions will ask you whether you met your learning goal.

### Where to get materials for your game ###

To build the game, you can use anything from your ME 30 kit, as well as anything else you can lay your hands on. Additionally, Nolop has buttons, potentiometers, LEDs, and other electronic components, as well as materials for laser cutting. You can use Nolop materials for your projects by recording them on the ME 30 tab located on a clipboard on top of the Nolop store. (At the end of the semester, the ME department pays Nolop back for all the parts we use.)

Bray also has materials for fabrication, leaning more toward the metal/nuts/bolts end of the spectrum.

If you need something not available at Nolop or Bray, please talk to Brandon, Zosia, or Kristen as soon as you can.

**Due date for game: Wednesday, November 12, IN CLASS**

Documentation due on Canvas by Wednesday, November 12, 11:59 PM

On November 12th, class will consist of us playing each other's games, marveling at our collective ingenuity and resourcefulness, and introducing Project 5. 


## Project 3: H-bridge
**Build an H-bridge motor controller**

The third project is to build a motor controller to meet the following requirements:

*   It consists of a PCB with connectors for a motor, plus power and control lines.
*   It also accepts power from a 2.1 x 5.5 mm plug from a 12 V wall adapter.
*   It has a power LED that lights up when motor power is available.
*   It can make a DC motor spin in both directions.
*   The motor current traces can handle 12 V and 5 A continuously without melting (see notes on PCB [ampacity](http://andnowforelectronics.com/notes/ampacity/))
*   It can be controlled by logic signals from a KB2040.  

Here is a graphical version of those first two bullet points about connectors.

**Due date for prototype: Monday, October 20, 11:59 PM**

To get started building your prototype H-bridge, review the [Low Power/high power](http://andnowforelectronics.com/notes/low-power-high-power/) and the H-bridge(http://andnowforelectronics.com/notes/h-bridges/) pages, including their mini-lecture videos on BJT and MOSFET transistors. After that, if you're stuck, consult the [H-bridge testing](http://andnowforelectronics.com/notes/demo-videos/#testing-an-h-bridge) demo video.  Note that this video is not intended to give you step-by-step building or testing instructions, but rather to give you a feel for the kind of approach you might take to building and testing this circuit. If your H-bridge prototype isn't working by the deadline for this prototype, don't worry!  Just submit to Canvas a photo of what you have, working or not.  

However, **once you do get your breadboard H-bridge working, take a video that shows it making the motor spin in both directions, controlled by a KB2040. You'll need that video eventually for your P3 final Canvas submission.**

**Due date for functional breadboard H-bridge and PCB submission: Monday, October 27, 11:59 PM**

When your PCB design is ready, you should [submit it to the fabricator](https://oshpark.com/), OSH Park. If you focus on compact design, you can keep the cost to around $10. (If this cost is a hardship, please tell your ME 30 instructor or Courtney Russon in the ME office, and we will cover the cost by ordering it for you, no questions asked.) After you order it, take a screenshot of your order confirmation (proof that you submitted your project on time). Also, take  screenshots of your circuit layout and PCB design in KiCad (it would be a good idea to save these screenshots for your portfolio). Upload all your screenshots to Canvas.

For this final submission to Canvas, you will also need to submit evidence that your breadboard H-bridge circuit is functional --  a video that shows it making the motor spin in both directions, controlled by a KB2040.




## Project 2: Simple game
**Build a simple game**

The next project is to use the basic electrical components we've covered in class with some mechanical fabrication to make a game that is at least mildly entertaining. The point here is NOT making the best game ever, but to set some goals for testing out your electromechanical skills. For your circuit for this project, use your breadboard. No PCBs needed.

This is a solo project, but we'll be brainstorming in groups.

You should bring your game to class on Wednesday, October 8th to share with your brainstorming group.

Due date (for game documentation submission): Wednesday, October 8th, 11:59PM

To keep things simple, there are a few required constraints.
Your game should:
* Use the DC gearmotor in your kit
* Use at least one transistor from your kit (can be a BJT or MOSFET)
* Require user interaction of some sort (e.g., pushing a button, pressing a key, interacting with a physical component)
* Fit inside a cube 20 cm on a side
* Be fabricated without 3D printing, except for a motor hub if needed (talk to an instructor if you have a particular reason you need to violate this constraint.)

The point of the constraints is to keep your game simple enough that you can complete it in 1.5 weeks.

In addition to planning to meet these constraints, you should also pick one learning goal for yourself for this project. Open-ended projects offer you an opportunity to bend the curriculum into the direction of your interests or to explore a potential new area of interest.

Here are some example learning goals:
* Get more comfortable with cordless drills and at least one other hand tool.
* Test my system to failure, then rebuild it stronger.
* Use only recycled/found materials.
* Complete my project 24 hours early.
* Model, predict and subsequently measure at least one mechanical property of my project.
* Use the laser cutter (which I have never used before).
* Make at least one part out of steel.
* Turn a part on a lathe at Bray.
* Spend at least 1/3 of my effort on the aesthetics of the project.

## Project 1: Power supply
**Build a breadboard power supply**

The first project is to build a power supply that meets the following requirements:

*   It consists of a PCB that plugs directly into a breadboard.
*   It accepts power from a 2.1 x 5.5 mm plug from a 12 V wall adapter.
*   It emits 12 V, 5 V, and 3.3 V (at the same time).

**Due date for Printed Circuit Board submission: Wednesday, September 24, 6:00PM**

**Due date for prototype on breadboard: Monday, September 15, 11:59PM**

When your design is ready, you should [submit it to the fabricator](https://oshpark.com/), OSH Park. It will cost you around $10\. After you submit it, take a screenshot of your order confirmation. You'll need to upload it to the Project 1 PCB assignment on Canvas. That will serve as proof that you submitted your project on time. If this cost is a hardship, please email your KiCad files to your ME 30 instructor, and we will order it for you.

### More details for Project 1

First of all, we're not trying to build anything revolutionary in this project. None of you have ever made a PCB before, so the point is to make something fairly simple to get comfortable with the process. If you search Amazon for "breadboard power supply", you'll see that you can buy various versions of things like this, though none with a 12 V passthrough, so far as we're aware.

Here's what a typical one of these things looks like.

![breadboard power supply](/img/breadboard-power-supply-from-amazon.jpg)

The image below shows the mechanical constraints for the PCB. You can make a board of whatever dimensions you want, but it needs to plug into the breadboard, so you probably want to make sure that the pins line up with the holes in the breadboard, as shown below. You can get by with 4 pins, but 8 will make the board stay in place a little more securely. Regardless of how many pins you use, make sure that each rail has only matching pins, i. e. don't accidentally connect 5 V to GND.

The dimension between the outer pins is estimated at 1.9 inches. It would be a really good idea to verify that dimension on your breadboard. Sometimes the breadboards are a little wider or narrower.

You can rely on the rest of the dimensions being quite accurate.

![](/img/breadboard-supply-mechanical-design.png)

In your project kit, you'll find all the components you'll need to build a prototype of your power supply on a breadboard. You build the prototype and make sure that you've got the wiring right. Then, make the PCB with the same connections. Finally, when your PCB arrives in the mail, you can reuse the prototype components on your PCB.

{{< hint danger >}}
**Important note: the pins on the 5V and 3.3V regulators are not in the same order!**
{{< /hint >}}

Check the datasheets for the components to see which pin is the input pin, which is the output pin, and which should connect to ground.

If you feel like you understand this project pretty well, or if you've made a basic circuitboard before, you could try adding additional features. Look at the open source [Ant breadboard power supply](https://www.crowdsupply.com/digital-cool/ant-bbps) for inspiration. The [schematics are available](https://gitlab.com/DigitalUncool/ant/-/blob/main/Hardware) if you're curious about the details.

### P1 prototype: what you should try before class #4 (photo of prototype due to Canvas 11:59pm, Wed., 9/15)

1. Read and try to make sense of the website notes on [voltage regulation](http://andnowforelectronics.com/notes/voltage-regulation/). Pay special attention to the circuit diagram showing the L7805C voltage regulator.
2. Try your best to make a breadboard circuit so that 12 V goes into your circuit and 5 V and 3.3 V come out. To get started, see the [schematic on the Voltage Regulators web page](http://andnowforelectronics.com/notes/voltage-regulation/). You'll need to use your [5V and 3.3V voltage regulator components](http://andnowforelectronics.com/notes/datasheets/#voltage-regulators).
3. Read as much of chapter 2 from the Practical Electronics textbook as you can.


## Project 0: Motor hub
**Create a secure motor attachment**

Later this semester, Projects 2 and 4 will require using a motor to actuate some part of an interactive game, and Projects 5 and 6 will involve motor-driven wheels. So in Project 0, you’ll building some knowledge about how to attach a part securely to a motor.

Your task in Project 0 is to design and build a motor hub that meets the following requirements:

*	It fits on and attaches to your DC motor shaft
*	It includes a 3 mm hole located 15 mm from the central axis of your DC motor shaft (you’ll insert a paper clip with a weighted string into this hole)
*	Around its circumference, it includes a channel or groove for winding up 1 meter of string
*	It stays attached securely enough to handle the amount of torque (load applied to hub) that stalls the motor when it is operating at 12 V

Your motor hub can be shaped however you like as long as it meets these requirements; the details are up to you.

![](/img/motor-hub-diagram.jpg)

Submit to Canvas (1) a photo of your motor hub and (2) a brief video (max 90 seconds) demonstrating that your motor hub meets the requirements above.

Bring your hub to lab on your designated due date. We hope to compile everyone’s results indicating the range of torques applied before the hubs either (a) slip on their motor shaft or (b) successfully stall the motor.

Due dates are staggered for Project 0 to spread out the demand on fabrication tools at Nolop and Bray. Your hub is due at the start of lab time on the date listed for your weekly lab day.

| Your Weekly Lab Day |  Your Project 0 Due Date | 
|---------------------|-------------------------|
| Wednesday      |  Wed., Oct. 1      |

{{< expand "Click for info on preparing to use the Bray Shop 3D printers, laser cutter, or lathe" "..." >}}
All students must complete the Bray [safety quiz](https://sites.tufts.edu/brayprivate/safety-quiz-complete-to-access-shop-spaces/) prior to their first visit to Bray. Completing the quiz will give you access to the Bray user site where you can submit appointment requests for training and fabrication time. 

Use of the Bray lathe requires lathe-specific training in the red zone, which must be booked by appointment.

ME and HFE students can use the Bray 3D printers and Bray design studio anytime using their Bray building access, which is 8am-midnight every day. 

Students can book an appointment to use the laser cutter or just walk in to use it during shop open hours as long as it is not reserved or in use by someone else.

{{< expand "Click to see procedure for motor hub testing" "..." >}}
Grab a few water bottles and be ready to add or remove water as needed. The goal is to find the max weight your motor + hub can lift without the hub slipping or the motor stalling. Start with some water in a bottle. Attach it to the hub with a paper clip (through the hole placed ~15 mm from the shaft axis) and a length of string. Supply 12 V to the motor and see if it can lift the weight without slipping of the hub. Repeat (adjusting the amount of water each time) until you get to a weight that either stalls the motor or makes the hub slip around the motor shaft.  Record this as your "slip/stall weight." 

How can you use your "slip/stall weight" and the distance between your shaft axis and paper clip attachment point to find your slip/stall TORQUE? 
You’ll need to enter this torque value in your Project 0 reflection (link provided in the Project 0 Canvas assignment).

For your Canvas submission, be sure to take a photo of your motor hub attachment and a video of it lifting weight. Compare its slip/stall torque performance to this class histogram created in a previous semester:
