There will eventually be a list of weekly updates here. If you're in the course, you got them via email, so this is just an archive.

Hello,

This email is from Brandon Stafford and Kristen Wendell. We're co-teaching ME 30 this fall, and you're enrolled in the class. Welcome! You're going to love it.

On SIS, ME30 is described as "Hybrid: In Person/Remote." That's a little vague, so we wanted to give a little more explanation.

The plan is that ME30 will be a virtual/hybrid model, with no required synchronous activities but opportunities for (a) real-time interaction with the instructors during scheduled class times and (b) in-person gathering with other students for those who wish. There are 9 pillars to the course:

    we mail/give you a project kit and plan for PCB fabrication and assembly
    collection of pre-existing resources: a textbook plus other stuff on the website
    short, topical videos, incrementally released, specific to our class
    central website for syllabus, links to everything else
    some kind of chat, probably Slack
    Zoom “pod” sessions held during scheduled class time -- pods are small groups of 16 students, each pod will do real-time Q&A with one instructor for half of each class session; students may choose to join remotely or to gather physically in our reserved classroom while participating, but instructors will run the pod sessions remotely
    community enrichment activities, like streaming electronics teardowns
    email status updates weekly, crossposted to website and chat
    some form of assessment

But just to be clear, this is all just a plan that we have been emailing back and forth about. The textbook is selected, the first 5 kits are ordered, and the first video has been recorded, but the editing has only just begun.

At the bottom of the message, you can see the pile of stuff we're getting ready for you. The kits will include two different microcontrollers-- an Arduino MKR 1010 Wifi and the new Raspberry Pi 4, plus all the stuff you'll need for prototyping electronic systems, controlling motors, and hooking up sensors. During the semester, you're also going to be getting printed circuit boards that you design professionally fabricated, probably in China.

We also have 3 awesome LA's for the course: Jared Jaramillo, Libby Albanese, and Jeremy Kanovsky. They have all either taken my electronics course previously or are the co-president of Tufts Robotics, or both.

If you have questions about the course, we're happy to answer them. My guess is that we'll get a lot of questions, so we'll collect them via email until Monday, and then send you all the answers at once. (If you have a question you'd rather have answered privately, or no questions at all, that's okay too.)

With great excitement,
Brandon Stafford and Kristen Wendell
