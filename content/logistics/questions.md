1. If we're trying to light up an LED with a 5 V supply, why do we need a resistor in series?
2. How much power can 5 V drive into a 100 ohm resistor? Could the resistors in your project kit handle that?
3. Does a motor get hotter when it's going fast or slow? Why?
4. Can you store more energy in a 100 uF capacitor or in a lithium ion battery of the same volume?
5. Why are extension cords rated for a certain voltage and current? How is a cord with higher ratings different?
