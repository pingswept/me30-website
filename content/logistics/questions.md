## Crucial questions for the semester  

1. If we're trying to light up an LED with a 5 V supply, why do we need a resistor in series?
2. How much power can 5 V drive into a 100 ohm resistor? Could the resistors in your project kit handle that?
3. Does a motor get hotter when it's going fast or slow? Why?
4. Can you store more energy in a 100 uF capacitor or in a lithium ion battery of the same volume?
5. Why are extension cords rated for a certain voltage and current? How is a cord with higher ratings different?
6. Using the stuff in your project kit, devise a few different ways to overload your voltage regulator circuit and tell us which one would dissipate the most power, and why.
7. How much energy is there in an AA battery? In a 9V battery? Which has higher energy density by volume, and why?
8. Compared to the N-channel set-up, what would you need to do differently to use a P-channel MOSFET to switch your 12-V DC gearmotor on and off? 
9. What would be the advantages of using the P-channel as a high-side driver instead of a low-side driver?
10. How would you select an appropriate motor for a robot elbow?
