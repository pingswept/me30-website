## Rough notes for class meetings

This page is more like the show notes for a podcast (links to stuff mentioned in class, reminders) than a coherent description of electronics.

## Class 1: Intro and build a voltage regulation circuit

### Introductions

Briana Bouchard, Brandon Stafford, and 8 LA's

Room assignments, how class works: three classrooms, short lectures, then build

Failure is success. But aim high and try hard!

Grading is on project completion, not any performance threshold.

### Voltage and current

AC voltage comes from the big gas turbine in Everett. Burn the gas, spin the magnets past coils of wire. You get sinusoidal voltage out.

Sidebar: voltage vs. current. Current is like water flowing in a hose. Voltage is like the pressure of the water in the hose.

Our DC power supply converts high (110 V) AC voltage to low (12 V) DC voltage.

### Voltage regulation

We need 4 components: two capacitors, one regulator, and one power jack, plus various wires and a breadboard.

Find those components in your kits.

Use the multimeter on the DC voltage setting to measure voltage.

### Your homework for Tuesday

1. Make it so that 12 V goes into your circuit and 5 V comes out.
2. Install Kicad.
3. Try to replicate the schematic.
4. Watch the Kicad demo videos, a total of 5 minutes, 59 seconds for [the first two demo videos](http://andnowforelectronics.com/notes/demo-videos/)
5. Read and try to absorb the web pages listed under ["What to study" on the calendar](http://andnowforelectronics.com/logistics/calendar/)
6. If you can absorb material from books efficiently, read as much of chapter 2 from the Practical Electronics textbook as you can.
