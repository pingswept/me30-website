# Electromechanical Systems and Robotics I Syllabus

ME 30, Electromechanical Systems and Robotics I, Section 01, class number 83723

## Course description

A project-based hands-on electronics boot camp, focusing on the design and fabrication of printed circuit boards and interfacing with microcontrollers from the Arduino and Raspberry Pi families.

## Course goals

The point of the course is to force students to gain experience with the practical challenges of building electrical hardware. Acting as a counterbalance to the largely theory-heavy curriculum of the modern university, the course makes students work in teams with their mostly inexperienced peers, where they argue, burn out chips, and struggle with lightly documented hardware. They face engineering failure and have to recover to succeed.

## Course expenses

### Electronics kits

We will buy you a bunch of stuff, and then you will give us $30. Need more details here. Let's link to a list of the kit contents on a different page, but list the total cost here.

### Printed circuit board fabrication

For this course, we will order PCBs from [OSHPark](https://docs.oshpark.com/services/two-layer/) in Lake Oswego, Oregon. Each of you will place two, or possibly 3, PCB orders over the course of the semester.

Each of the 2 or 3 orders will cost around $10. (The price is actually $5 per square inch. If you can make your boards smaller, they will be cheaper, but most of the boards end up being around 2 square inches.)

Shipping is free.

### Textbooks

There are two recommended textbooks for the class. You are not required to buy either, but given our socially distant operations this fall, you are encouraged to consider more independent modes of learning as a supplement to the rest of the course.

1. [Practical Electronics for Inventors, Fourth Edition, by Paul Scherz and Simon Monk](https://www.amazon.com/Practical-Electronics-Inventors-Fourth-Scherz/dp/1259587541/), $22.49
2. [Making Things Move by Dustyn Roberts](https://www.amazon.com/Making-Mechanisms-Inventors-Hobbyists-Artists/dp/0071741674/), $19.79

## Assignments

TBD

## Grading

Grades will be based mostly on your project work.

Each project will be worth 7 points, and then scaled by the number of weeks allocated to complete the project. (So a project 4 weeks in duration is worth twice as much as a project 2 weeks in duration.) For each day (or fraction thereof) a project is late, you will lose 1 point (before scaling), so a project that is 1 week late is worth 0 points. To receive credit for a project, your project must also meet the project requirements, which are published at the start of the project. For example, if a project requires fabrication of a PCB, and you don't make one, you lose credit, roughly in proportion to the fraction of the requirements unsatisfied. For group projects with N people per group, you should do roughly 1/N of the work.

If you complete all the projects on time within the requirements, or at least 95% of that, you have earned an A. If you hit around 85%, that's a B. You can calculate the details if you want, but the main message is that you should complete all the projects, and you should do them on time.

On the one hand, this sounds kind of tough. On the other hand, if you actually like building electronics, you will do fine. We have a *very* wide spectrum of experience in this class. Note that the project requirements do not include any kind of performance target (like, "make a robot that can run faster than 18 mph"), but rather broad categorical requirements, like "Your circuit must run off batteries." In this example, I do care whether you made a legitimate attempt to make the circuit run off batteries; we don't care how well your circuit works, because that's based largely on your level of experience relative how ambitious a project you tried to build. Our goal is to get you to try to build ambitious projects in a few broad categories, not cross some arbitrary threshold that would be easy for some of you and intensely difficult for others.

## Zoom etiquette

TBD. Please use video if you can? If you can't pay attention, leave?

## Lectures

Tu, Th 1:30-2:45. Not sure where yet.

## Financial constraints

If, for whatever reason, you cannot afford to pay for the stuff needed for this class, please let one of the teachers know, either in Slack or via email. In virtually all cases, the Mechanical Engineering Department will pay for whatever you can't afford; if they can't, we will. Under no circumstances should your education suffer because you don't have the right tools or supplies.

## Honesty

We take honesty very seriously. Not only are we required to report violations of academic integrity, we are glad to do so. We are all fortunate to be at Tufts; there is no excuse for squandering that opportunity by representing someone else's work as your own. If you're unsure about the details, read the [Tufts Academic Integrity Policy](https://students.tufts.edu/student-affairs/student-life-policies/academic-integrity-policy).
