# Printed circuit board fabrication

For this course, we will order PCBs from OSHPark: https://docs.oshpark.com/services/two-layer/ Each of you will place two, or possibly 3 PCB orders over the course of the semester. Each order will cost around $10. (The price is actually $5 per square inch. If you can make your boards smaller, they will be cheaper.) Shipping is free.
