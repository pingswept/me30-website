## Significant milestones

* 1833: "Analytical Engine" thought up and partially built by Charles Babbage. Could read a series of numbers, operate on them, and print out a result. (Need to check improve this description.)
* 1843: Ada Lovelace comes up with the idea of a computer program, where numbers could be used to represent other stuff, like music.
* 1936: A computer that can rewrite its own instructions conceived of by Alan Turing
* 1943: Colossus, vacuum-tube-based computer
* ENIAC, first electronic digital computer in the US
* 1945: von Neumann architecture invented: data and instructions stored in same memory bank, separate from CPU
* 1947: transistor invented at Bell Labs
* 1948: Claude Shannon sorts out information theory, starts people using the word "bit" for "binary digit"
* 1954: FORTRAN, first widely used programming language, invented at IBM. Still used today for fast calculations, as in the open source libraries [ATLAS](https://hpc.llnl.gov/software/mathematical-software/atlas), BLAS, and LAPACK.
* 1955: "Artificial intelligence" summer institute proposed at Dartmouth, in New Hampshire.
* 1958-9: Texas Instruments and Fairchild Semiconductor invent the integrated circuit, where multiple transistors and other circuitry are fabricated together on one chip.
* 1965: Gordon Moore says transistors per device will double every year.
* 1969: ARPANET invented by US government agency ARPA
* 1975: Gordon Moore says transistors per device will double every OTHER year-- "Moore's Law." [Basically right, 1970-2020.](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Moore's_law#/media/File:Moore's_Law_Transistor_Count_1970-2020.png)
* 1981: IBM personal computer and Microsoft's MS-DOS released
* 1984: First computer with usable graphical interface, Macintosh, released
* 1990: world-wide web invented at CERN in Switzerland
* 2005: First Arduino developed in Italy
* 2012: First Raspberry Pi developed in England
