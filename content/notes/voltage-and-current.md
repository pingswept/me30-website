## What's the difference between voltage and current?

Voltage and current are the two ways we measure electricity.

Current is easier, so let's start with that. Current is a measure of how many electrons are flowing past a point per second. Current is measured in amperes, called amps for short, and abbreviated "A". 1 amp means that 6.24 x 10<sup>18</sup> electrons per second are flowing. That's 6.24 quintillion electrons. Physicists call that number of electrons a coulomb. A chemist might call it around 100 micromoles. A baker might call it 500 quadrillion dozens of electrons.

To give you an idea of scale, microcontrollers and phones run on currents of 1-100 mA ("mA" is a milliamp). A blender or a vacuum cleaner might pull 1-15 A. (Wall outlets are rated for 15 A before a circuit breaker trips, usually.) Electric cars draw 100-1000 A.

But current doesn't tell the whole story. Voltage tells the rest. Voltage is a measure of potential energy per electron.
