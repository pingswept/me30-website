**Identifying and mitigating discriminatory design impacts**

One goal of ME 30 is to empower you to use tools of electronics and robotics to design new technologies. We acknowledge that with that power comes much responsibility, including the responsibility to understand and reduce the potential for electronic systems to negatively impact some individuals and groups even as they positively impact the lives or work of others.

# Stakeholding Mapping

Stakeholder mapping presents one tool for analyzing a technological design for its potential discriminatory impacts. In this activity, you'll work in a team to analyze different technologies using stakeholder mapping as a common framework to identify discriminatory benefits/burdens. 

## Step 1 – Stakeholder Identification

Analyzing stakeholders is a practice that can help engineers recognize the variety of individuals groups that have an interest in an engineering decision, whether they are aware of that interest or not. When making a map, the first step is to identify potential stakeholders. These could include potential customers, users, laborers, community residents, manufacturers, suppliers, or competitors related to a product. Stakeholders can even be non-human, like wildlife or the environment.

The most generative stakeholder analysis, consider not just the direct operation of the technology by a single user but also its production, disposal, and use at scale.

As designers identify stakeholders, benefits, and burdens, they consider: 
- labor required to produce, operate, and dispose of the technology
- energy consumption required to produce, operate, and dispose of the technology
- materials used in the technology
- accessibility of the technology
- safety of the technology

## Step 2 – Interest and Power Analysis

Different stakeholders can be located on a 2-dimensional plot of relative interest (the importance to stakeholder) vs power (influence over technology). Weighing potential benefits and burdens and considering whether they align with one’s values can help engineers come to a decision on whether or not to pursue a project or design change.

**Interest** means how much a stakeholder will be affected by the technology, whether or not they are aware of that impact. 

**Power** means how much influence a stakeholder has on the technology.

## Your Task

**Part A.** For each of the three technologies, assign one student on your team to conduct stakeholder mapping according to Steps 1 and 2 above. Use specific ideas from the provided article or website as sources of evidence for your analysis. You are welcome to conduct additional research on the technology as well.

**3) Electric vehicle batteries**

**Part B.** Share your findings across the three technologies. Discuss the question:
(need to add compare/contrast question here, something about discriminatory benefits/burdens at three different levels or spheres of impact )

**Part C.** Click the box below to read about a hypothetical design plan. Use stakeolder analysis (Steps 1 and 2 above) to make a recommendation about whether to proceed with this design work.
