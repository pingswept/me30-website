**Identifying discriminatory design**

One goal of ME 30 is to empower you to use tools of electronics and robotics to design new technologies. We acknowledge that with that power comes much responsibility, including the responsibility to understand how robotic systems can negatively impact some individuals and groups even as they positively impact the lives or work of others — and the responsibility to learn how to proactively avoid this kind of discriminatory design.

Luckily we have sociologist [Ruha Benjamin](https://aas.princeton.edu/people/ruha-benjamin), a professor in Princeton’s Department of African American Studies, to help us. Benjamin’s scholarship uncovers the ways in which racial discrimination and marginalization are designed into technology — often unintentionally, but also at times intentionally. Please watch her 2015 TEDx Talk “From Park Bench to Lab Bench: Whose future are we designing” [here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_8RrX4hjCr0).

2. If the racist soap dispenser was **not** tested with people with dark skin, why might that be?
3. If the racist soap dispenser was tested with people with dark skin, why was it still sold?
