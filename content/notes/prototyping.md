## Breadboards vs. protoboards vs. PCBs

There are three major ways to build electronics:

1. solderless breadboards, like you have in your project kit
2. protoboards, which are printed circuit boards with a generic grid of useful holes
3. printed circuit boards
4. (plugging together components with connectors, but that's more assembling than building, I would say)

## Breadboards

In the days of yore, when electronic components were big and bulky, we used to prototype by screwing components down to a piece of wood, like a wooden cutting board you would use to cut bread. Hence, "breadboarding."

Now, we use solderless breadboards. The modifier "solderless" is just to distinguish them from protoboards, which are like breadboards, but need solder for assembly.

Here are a few facts about breadboards that are not immediately obvious.

* Each row subsection of 5 pins is connected together, but the two 5 pin subsections are not connected across the central groove.
* The groove is there so that you can plug chips across it and have each pin hit a different group of 5 pins.
