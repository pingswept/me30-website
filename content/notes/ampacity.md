## Ampacity

Ampacity is a portmanteau of "amps" and "capacity." How many amps can a PCB trace handle before it blows apart-- that is its ampacity.

Kicad has a calculator that helps you estimate how wide a trace has to be to limit the temperature rise of a trace to a given value for any particular level of current.
