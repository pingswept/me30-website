## Common characteristics

There are a few characteristics that virtually all motors share. Let's go over those first; then we can discuss different variants.

First off, every motor has a part that spins, called the **rotor** and a part that stands still, called the **stator**. Usually, the rotor is in the middle of the motor, and the stator is around the outside, but there are also motors called "outrunners" where the outside rotates and the stator is fixed inside.

*Add more commonalities here*

## Fundamental principle

The fundamental principle of a motor is to run some electric current in a wire that is perpendicular to a magnetic field, which generates a force on the wire.
