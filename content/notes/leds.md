## Light-emitting diodes (LEDs)

A light-emitting diode is a piece of silicon that blocks current flow in one direction, but when current flows in the other direction, light comes out. I could try to write something hand-wavy about bandgaps here, but the truth is that they're like magic to me.  

When you include an LED in a circuit, typically you'll want to include a [resistor to limit the current](/notes/resistors/#typical-application-current-limiter) drawn by the LED.
