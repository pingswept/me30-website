Sociotechnical Tenets:

- **Technology is not inevitable and does not always improve society.** Engineering and computing are subjective, require judgment, and require tolerating uncertainty – there is never one right solution or decision.
- **Data, algorithms, and technology are neither neutral nor objective.** Technology embodies the dominant values of the society and the creators who design it, which tends to reproduce and/or exacerbate existing inequalities.
- **The effects of technology are unevenly felt across groups of people and more-than-human actors.** Who/what benefits and who/what is harmed typically aligns with historical power imbalances.
