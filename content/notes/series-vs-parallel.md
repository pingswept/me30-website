## Series connections

Things that are connected in series are connected end-to-end, like a train.

If you connect a bunch of resistors in series, the resistances add up. All the current has to flow through every resistor, so each resistor restricts the flow more.

## Parallel connections

Things that are connected in parallel are connected such that they share a common input as well as a common output.

If you connect a bunch of resistors in parallel, the total resistance decreases as you add more resistors. If you connect, say, 5 identical resistors in parallel, the total resistance will be 1/5th of a single resistor. The current will split into 5 separate streams, each equal to 1/5th of the total current.
