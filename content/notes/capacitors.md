## Physical description

All capacitors are thin plates of conductive material separated by a thin layer of insulating material. For the cylindrical electrolytic capacitors in your kit, they are made of two narrow strips of metal foil separated by a strip of thin brown paper, rolled up like a cinnamon roll.

## Farads

Capacitors are measured in farads. 1 F is 1 coulomb/volt, a measure of how much charge it takes to raise the voltage of the capacitor by 1 volt. Oddly, most of the capacitors we use in electronics are small relative to 1 F, usually in the range of microfarads (uF, 10^-6) down to picofarads (pF, 10^-12).

## But what is the point of them?

Capacitors can be used in two main ways: as a small battery and as a filter.
