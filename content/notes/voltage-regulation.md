## Why do we need voltage regulators?

(Make sure you understand the difference between [voltage and current](/notes/voltage-and-current/), or this won't make any sense.)

Suppose, as an example, you want to make your own toaster oven. You've done some heat transfer calculations, and you think you want the electric heaters in your oven to deliver around 1500 W.

Here are two ways you could do it. You could get a 15 V power supply that can supply at least 100 A and connect it to a heater with a resistance of 0.15 ohms. 15/0.15 = 100, so 100 A would flow. 15 * 100 = 1500, so you would be delivering 1500 W.

You could also get a 150 V power supply that can supply at least 10 A and connect it to a heater with a resistance of 15 ohms. 150/15 = 10, so 10 A would flow. 150 * 10 = 1500, so once again you would be delivering 1500 W.

So, is there any difference?
