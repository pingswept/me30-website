## The big picture

There's a huge amount to learn about transistors; the topic can be overwhelming. First, let's narrow things down to just two common varieties of transistor and explain two ways each can be used.

## Bipolar junction transistor (BJT)

If someone just says "transistor" to you, they probably mean a bipolar junction transistor, or BJT. If someone mentions an NPN or PNP transistor, they are also talking about BJT's.

The fundamental characteristic of a BJT is that it is a **current-controlled device**: putting a small amount of current through one leg of the device allows a larger current to flow through another leg of the device.

## Metal oxide semiconductor field effect transistor (MOSFET)

MOSFETs are a newer variety of transistor than BJTs. If someone mentions an N-channel or P-channel device, they're usually talking about a MOSFET.

The fundamental characteristic of a MOSFET is that it's a **voltage-controlled device**: raising the voltage on one leg of the device reduces the resistance between two other legs of the device.

## Two ways to use a transistor

There are two major ways that a transistor can be used: as an **amplifier** or a **switch**. In digital electronics, which has largely superseded analog electronics over the last few decades, we largely use transistors as switches rather than amplifiers.

(It should be noted here that because physical phenomena are, in reality, analog in nature, at the lowest levels, electronics will always be analog. But, for everyday engineering tasks, you will largely encounter digital devices. If the analog stuff is interesting to you, dive into it; a deeper understanding of analog stuff can only benefit you.)
