</h2>
<p>The goal of Electromechanical Systems and Robotics is to force students to gain experience with the practical challenges of building electrical hardware. Acting as a counterbalance to the largely theory-heavy curriculum of the modern university, the course makes students work in teams with their mostly inexperienced peers, where they argue, burn out chips, and struggle with lightly documented hardware. They face engineering failure and have to recover to succeed.</p>

<h2 id="textbooks">
  Textbooks
  <a class="anchor" href="#textbooks">#</a>
</h2>
<p>There will be no textbook for the class. Instead, you will be asked to buy two small microcontrollers and a few accessories.</p>
<h2 id="assignments">
  Assignments
  <a class="anchor" href="#assignments">#</a>
</h2>
<p>While there may occasionally be readings or other tasks asked of you, the majority of your effort in this class will be on project work.</p>
<h2 id="grading">
  Grading
  <a class="anchor" href="#grading">#</a>
</h2>
<p>There will be no quizzes or exams. Grades will be based on your project work.</p>
<p>Each project will be worth 7 points, and then scaled by the number of weeks allocated to complete the project. (So a project 4 weeks in duration is worth twice as much as a project 2 weeks in duration.) For each day (or fraction thereof) a project is late, you will lose 1 point (before scaling), so a project that is 1 week late is worth 0 points. To receive credit for a project, your project must also meet the project requirements, which are published at the start of the project. For example, if a project requires fabrication of a PCB, and you don&rsquo;t make one, you lose credit, roughly in proportion to the fraction of the requirements unsatisfied. For group projects with N people per group, you should do roughly 1/N of the work.</p>
<p>If you complete all the projects on time within the requirements, or at least 95% of that, you have earned an A. If you hit around 85%, that&rsquo;s a B. You can calculate the details if you want, but the main message is that you should complete all the projects, and you should do them on time.</p>
<p>On the one hand, this sounds kind of tough. On the other hand, if you actually like building electronics, you will do fine. We have a <em>very</em> wide spectrum of experience in this class. Note that the project requirements do not include any kind of performance target (like, &ldquo;make a robot that can run faster than 18 mph&rdquo;), but rather broad categorical requirements, like &ldquo;Your circuit must run off batteries.&rdquo; In this example, I do care whether you made a legitimate attempt to make the circuit run off batteries; I don&rsquo;t care how well your circuit works, because that&rsquo;s based largely on your level of experience relative how ambitious a project you tried to build. My goal is to get you to try to build ambitious projects in a few broad categories, not cross some arbitrary threshold that would be easy for some of you and intensely difficult for others.</p>
<h2 id="no-electronics-during-lectures">
  No electronics during lectures
  <a class="anchor" href="#no-electronics-during-lectures">#</a>
</h2>
<p>Generally, I need too much of your attention to allow distractions like cell phones and laptops in class. There will be rare exceptions in class, like when we&rsquo;re using computers as tools for designing the stuff we&rsquo;re making. If I have to remind you about this a few times, I&rsquo;ll ask you to leave class. If you think this might be a problem for you, I would recommend putting your phone somewhere inaccessible during class. You should probably also think carefully about the role technology is playing in your life. (I should add that I also feel the tug of the phone, though maybe not as strongly as some of you.)</p>
<h2 id="lectures">
  Lectures
  <a class="anchor" href="#lectures">#</a>
</h2>
<p>Tu, Th 1:30-2:45 in <a href="http://campusmaps.tufts.edu/medford/#fid=205"></a>, the Science and Engineering Complex, 200 College Avenue, 1st floor, <a href="http://engineering.tufts.edu/computing/facilities/blake">Room 22, also called &ldquo;Blake-Perlman Computational Studio&rdquo; or &ldquo;that room with the glass wall next to the cafe in the SEC.&quot;</a></p>
<p>Project work will take place in Blake, the <a href="https://nolop.org">Nolop makerspace</a>, and <a href="https://sites.tufts.edu/bray/">Bray Lab</a>.</p>

  Financial constraints
  <a class="anchor" href="#financial-constraints">#</a>
</h2>
<p>If, for whatever reason, you cannot afford to pay for the stuff needed for this class, please let me know, either in person or via email. In virtually all cases, the Mechanical Engineering Department will pay for whatever you can&rsquo;t afford; if they can&rsquo;t, I will. Under no circumstances should your education suffer because you don&rsquo;t have the right tools or supplies.</p>
<h2 id="honesty">
  Honesty
  <a class="anchor" href="#honesty">#</a>
</h2>
<p>I take honesty very seriously. Not only am I required to report violations of academic integrity, I am glad to do so. We are all fortunate to be at Tufts; there is no excuse for squandering that opportunity by representing someone else&rsquo;s work as your own. If you&rsquo;re unsure about the details, read the <a href="https://students.tufts.edu/student-affairs/student-life-policies/academic-integrity-policy">Tufts Academic Integrity Policy</a>.</p>
